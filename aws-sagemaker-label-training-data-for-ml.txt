# Tutorial " Label Training Data for Machine Learning"
https://aws.amazon.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial-label-training-data/

Step 1:
# Check to make sure that you have VPC (if account was created corerctly you will)
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home?region=us-east-1#Home:

# Set up your Amazon SageMaker Studio domain
# Follow this link while being logged in yuor IAM admin account:
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://sagemaker-sample-files.s3.amazonaws.com/libraries/sagemaker-user-journey-tutorials/v2/CFN-SM-IM-Lambda-catalog.yaml&stackName=CFN-SM-IM-Lambda-Catalog

	Stack name : CFN-SM-IM-Lambda-Catalog
	Domain name: StudioDomain
	UserProfileName: studio-user

Create Task and wait ~10 minutes

Step 2: 
Open Sagemaker Studio (everything will pre-popuate)
File - New - Notebook

select Data Science. The Python 3 kernel is selected automatically. Under Instance type, choose ml.t3.medium. Choose Select.


Images: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02
To minimize the cost of this tutorial, you use a sample set of 10 images, with two images from each of the following categories: airplanes, cars, ferries, helicopters, and motorbikes.
The sample set of 10 images is already available in the Amazon S3 bucket sagemaker-sample-files


import sagemaker

sess = sagemaker.Session()
bucket = sess.default_bucket()

!aws s3 sync s3://sagemaker-sample-files/datasets/image/caltech-101/inference/ s3://{bucket}/ground-truth-demo/images/

print('Copy and paste the below link into a web browser to confirm the ten images were successfully uploaded to your bucket:')
print(f'https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/{bucket}/ground-truth-demo/images/')

print('\nWhen prompted by Sagemaker to enter the S3 location for input datasets, you can paste in the below S3 URL')

print(f's3://{bucket}/ground-truth-demo/images/')

print('\nWhen prompted by Sagemaker to Specify a new location, you can paste in the below S3 URL')

print(f's3://{bucket}/ground-truth-demo/labeled-data/')

*****************************************************************

Go to S3 buket sagemaker-us-east-1-248775955867
There shoould be a folder ground-truth-demo/ with 10 images

Open the SageMaker console. In the left navigation pane, select Ground Truth, Labeling jobs. Then choose Create labeling job.
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth?region=us-east-1#/labeling-jobs

Create job vehicle-labeling-data 
select automated data setup
browse S3 and select sagemaker-us-east-1-248775955867 and navigate to the images
s3://sagemaker-us-east-1-248775955867/ground-truth-demo/images/

Specify output:
s3://sagemaker-us-east-1-248775955867/ground-truth-demo/labeled-data

Data type: image

Create new role: any S3 buckets

Task Type: select image and image classification (single label)

select Amazon Mechanical Turk
checkmark no adult content and understand that data will be labeled by contractors


Add message Please select the label that best matches the image below. You can choose only 1 label per image
Give them a message: Please select the label that best matches the image below. You can choose only 1 label per image.

Give them labels: Airplane, Car, Ferry, Helicopter, Motorbike
Expand and add a message: If there are multiple vehicles in a single image, choose the most prominent vehicle in the image.

Clean up your AWS resources :


In S3 console delete all objects
- delete all files stored in the buckets first

In Cloud Formation delete template

In Sagemaker and delete domain
